## Open Ended Learning
Moving forward, this `README.md` will be updated weekly with:
- An **Overview** of the week's learning.
- **Notes** prepared during the week.
- **Outcomes** from the learning process.
- Possibly, **social media posts** reflecting the weekly outcomes.

Good Luck and Happy Learning! üéâ
